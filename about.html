		<h5>I am a product designer currently pursuing a master's degree in mechanical engineering at the University of California, San Diego (UCSD). As an undergraduate, I double-majored in product design (B.A.) and structural engineering (B.S.). Currently, I am the only student from UCSD to receive a degree in product design, which was developed as an interdisciplinary major with courses in engineering, cognitive science, visual arts, business management, and so on. Design is my biggest passion in life, and I truly take pride in everything I work on. Through my previous work, one can see the amount of effort and detail I put into each project; projects where I was challenged, and where I learned to sharpen my skills in design and engineering. I hope to attain an industry position where I can continually grow as a designer and create truly innovative products.
