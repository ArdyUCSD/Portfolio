						<p>The Modular Attachable Drone is a 3D printed drone that is portable, versatile, scalable, and of course, aesthetically pleasing. In terms of configuring the drone, each housed motor separates from the central body, which allows for multiple variations. Also, they are able to stack on top of each other when they aren't in use, which makes it way more portable than most modular drones on the market today. MAD also allows for the attachment of a wide range of accessories: Everything from GoPro mounts to landing gears and even basketball hoops are attached with ease!

						<p>The gyroscopic ship stabilizer is a research project conducted under Professor Hidenori Murakami and his Ph.D. student Oscar Rios. It involves utilizing the moment created by gyroscopes to stabilize a small ship/object in the ocean. The testing device is a proof of concept for the equations derived Dr. Murakami and Mr. Rios. Essentially, the motion the gyroscopes generate a consistent oscillation that is compared to the analytical solution.

	    				<p>Today, there are limited options for teaching children about basic circuitry concepts, so there is an unmet need of creating a fun way of getting children ages four to eight interested in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics. ModBlocks are modular electronic blocks that enable children to build basic circuits. They are easy to use because they are magnetic and connectable. Also, they are very intuitive because of the understandable faces and ease-of-use. This is a fun way to get children ages 4-8 into electronics and to develop their problem-solving skills. More information can be found in the <a class="clickable" href="documents/ModBlocksFinal.pdf">presentation slide deck.</a>

	    				<p>This is a toy designed for children eight and above aimed at allowing children to make their own music with multiple instruments at a low cost. In the most general sense, Musi-Me is a device that lets kids play and record drums and a synthesizer by being connected to a computer running GarageBand through MIDI and an audio input. They can, through GarageBand, use any number of drum sounds. Also, they can add effects to change the sound of the drums or synthesizer. One might ask how this product is new in any way since synthesizers and drum pads have been around for a long time, but there are no easy to use products that combine something digital like a synthesizer with physical drum pads that mimic using real drums. By doing that, kids have a much more tangible experience that is easy to follow and learn from. In effect, it will get them excited to learn more instruments and a push to create music on their own.

	    				<p>This art project emulates the experience I have when I go to bed, which entails increased activity when the lights are turned off because I always go into deep thought once I'm supposed to sleep. The device is basically idle when the lights are on, but LEDs and a piezo speaker are activated once the lights are turned off. The code written makes it so, after a 5 second delay, a low frequency is played, and a single set of LEDs flicker on and off randomly. It increases in frequency and speed until a random loop is played. My experience with product design helped me in thinking of a compact device that could fully enclose the electronics, so it would create a more real experience to the people observing it.

	    				<p>The Sun Disk is a portable, sunction cup, solar panel inside of a plastic casing. It has a USB connector to charge devices on-the-go. Also, a hinge that disappears into the product allows the user to place the panel at the optimal angle, yet it can be tucked away out of sight when not needed. The design of this product is meant to combine functionality and minimalism in a seamless way. One may argue that similar products exist; however, no product combines the following features into one device: A seamless hinge for placing the product at an optimal angle, indicators to show if the device is getting enough light, a simple and aesthetically pleasing design, and an enclosed battery (so the device can act similarly to a portable charger).
